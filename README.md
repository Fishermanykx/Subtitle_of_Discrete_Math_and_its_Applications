# Subtitle_of_Discrete_Math_and_its_Applications

## Intention of the project
The .ass files are subtitles of the course: **Discrete Mathematics and its Applications, Arsdigita University**[link to its main page](http://www.aduni.org/courses/discrete/index.php?view=cw). 
The original videos don't have subtitles, and the lecturer's speaking speed is a little fast, causing  some inconvience to students whose mother tongue are not English. As a result, I made the subtitle using automatic machine identification. However, **as there are a lot inaccurate words in the subtitle, I create this**  **repo to fix all the existing errors  in the subtitles.**
**Anyone interested in the project can take part in and make pull requests. Thank you for your kind and active participation!**
